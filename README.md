# Enhancing DILI Toxicity Prediction by Combining Graph Attention (GATNN) and Dense Neural Network (DNN)

In this file, we would like to share how to use code files in every folder repository. The diagram block of the model is shown in the picture below.
We created an ensemble that connected two models with different methods in parallel processing. Every output of the model was concatenated in a classification layer.
The colored block in the DNN sub-model means that the model is used as a pre-trained model and is trained and saved first before it is joined to the GATNN model. All weights in the DNN model 
would be frozen and only weights in the GATNN and Classification layer would be trainable.

# Manual 
We coded the model using the Jupyter Notebook platform. All the models were created based on the Pytorch and some data features were generated by using RDkit library packages. 
The environment was set by Anaconda and it can be seen in the **"dili_environment.txt"** file. 
 - python==3.11.4
 - numpy==1.25.0
 - pandas==1.5.3
 - rdkit==2023.3.2
 - scikit_learn==1.3.0
 - torch==2.0.1
 - torch_geometric==2.3.1
 - torchvision==0.15.2

# 2. Data_preprocessing
In this folder, we made data preprocessing to repair, select, reduce, and find the most important data feature.
the file **"preprocessing_data.ipynb"** will generate the finally clean data. 
all the data would be saved as graph-structured data, reduced fingerprint data, and reduced descriptor data.
